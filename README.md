## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your computer.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-github-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-github-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Firebase**
    This project requires a Firebase project to handle the backend.

    * Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
    * In your new project, enable the following services:
        * **Firestore Database**
        * **Authentication** (enable the "Email/Password" sign-in method)
        * **Storage**
    * Go to your Project Settings and in the "General" tab, scroll down to "Your apps". Click on the web icon `</>` to register a new web app.
    * Firebase will provide you with a `firebaseConfig` object. Copy these keys.

4.  **Create an environment file**
    * In the root of the project, create a new file named `.env`.
    * Copy the contents of `.env.example` (if you have one) or use the template below and fill it in with your keys from the previous step.

    ```env
    # .env file

    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN_HERE"
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID_HERE"
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET_HERE"
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_SENDER_ID_HERE"
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_APP_ID_HERE"
    ```

### Running the Application

Once the setup is complete, you can run the app with:

```sh
npm start
```

This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.
